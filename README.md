Miniboa-py3
===========

Miniboa-py3 is an asynchronous, single-threaded, poll-based Telnet server
written in Python. It supports many users (512 on Windows, 1000 on Unix) and
is fully cross-platform.

This module is ideal for everything from MUD servers to services requiring an
administration interface.

Miniboa-py3 is a fork of [Jim Storch's miniboa](https://code.google.com/p/miniboa/)
updated with full support for Python 3.

For full documentation, see the miniboa project page.
